Fully Responsive Website Project For Practice Purpose.

DESCRIPTION:
In this project I will practice HTML & CSS by building a responsive website using media queries, css variables, design system, flexbox, grid, etc.
         Im very excited to revise my CSS skills by building this project and looking forward to learn new things also. The most important concept which I learned by this project is DESIGN SYSTEM.

In real life project our code may repeat again and agian and again which means except some properties our project have similar styles which means the css code is also similar, In order to stop the code repetition we use Design System. So generally what we do is we create a file and inside that file we write all the common repetitive style rules and when ever we need them we have just to include them so that we dont have to repeat same code again and again plus our code looks very neat and clean.

Design System,

HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT:
You can use simply by visiting the below link:

Some plugins helps me a lot for writing code more easily and efficiently which are:
The very first plugin i've installed is Auto Close Tag (Jun Han) what it will do is the moment we hit the angle bracket, automatically the closing tag has been written. So using this plugin we can save a lot of time while writing code.
Next plugin is Auto Rename Tag (Jun Han) when we change any tag then it will automatically chane the tag on the other end.
Next plugin is Better Comments: Gives us beautifully colored comments 
Next is IntelliSence for CSS class names in HTML: It provides CSS class name completion for the HTML class attribute based on the definitions found in our workspace.
Next is Live Server: It will launch a development local server with live reload feature.
Next is prettier: for formatting code.
Next is px to rem: converts px to rem, and vice versa.
